Solutions
---------

        1   The function body exists because it may be called from another file.
            The compiler cannot know about this before link time.

        2   If the function was declared with the "static" keyword (which, in C,
            is something  like "private  to this file  only") then  the function
            body will disappear if there is no caller within the file.
